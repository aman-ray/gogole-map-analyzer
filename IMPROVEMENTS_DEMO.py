BUSINESS EXTRACTION FIXES - DEMONSTRATION SCRIPT
=================================================

This script demonstrates the improvements made to fix the business data extraction issues.

BEFORE (Problems):
- ❌ Clicking on listings didn't navigate to business detail pages properly
- ❌ Business name extraction using outdated selectors (finding "Results" instead of names)
- ❌ Phone number and address extraction had limited selector coverage
- ❌ No error handling or debugging for extraction failures

AFTER (Solutions):
- ✅ Enhanced navigation with URL validation and retry logic
- ✅ Modern Google Maps selectors (35+ selectors across name/phone/address)
- ✅ Smart text filtering to avoid UI elements
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with debug screenshots
- ✅ Detailed logging for troubleshooting
